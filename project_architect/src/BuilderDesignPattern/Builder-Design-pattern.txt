Builder Design pattern
======================
* One of the most important creational design pattern
* Builder Design Pattern was introduced mostly to resolve some of the problems with Factory Design pattern that is
 why we came up with  Builder Design Pattern.(In case we have to pass too many parametersthen it will create problem)

* Nested class is used to group the class belonging to the similar group.It improves code redabilty.
We can hide the implementation with the help of inner nested class.With the help of nested inner class we can 
access private constructor of the outer class.

if we dont want optional object then also we have to pass those object as null in parameters)
* In builder patten we need static nested class
* Optional value will return with default value of the object along with required values
