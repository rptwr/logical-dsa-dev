Transient and Volatile
===============================
* Transient Keyword: It is a keyword which will mark a variable.It will not marked to be serialized when it is persisted
Here variable wont go only default value of data type will go.for example int a = 10; then only 0 will go

* Volatile Keyword: Volatile keyword is used to modify the value of a variable by different threads. It is also
 used to make classes thread safe. It means that multiple threads can use a method and instance of the classes at
  the same time without any problem.

* Thread may have different values for same variable.for ex if we have int a = 5 in main memory then Thread 1 can
 have int i = 10, Thread2 can have int i = 5;

* When thread modifies variable value then it is not reflecting in main memory instantly
* short-term memory is called cpu cache
* Cpu cache will write every thing in the main memory but it needs some time.

* Data Inconsistency: when thread changes the variable value then that value might not reflect immediately to the memory.
* If we use volatile keyword then Whenever a Thread 1 is changing value of variable it will directly change the value 
in the main memory.There is no concept of short lived cache memory when we use volatile.
